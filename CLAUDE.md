# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a new, empty repository. No build system, test framework, or source code exists yet.

## Rules

### Language
- Always communicate with the user in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR).

### Interaction Flow
- At each interaction, present 3 options: 1 for yes, 2 for no, 3 for a context-based alternative.
- Before executing any complex task, show a plan and wait for user approval.
- Once a task is approved, execute it to completion without asking for permission at each step.

### Code Standards
- All code and file names must be in English.
- Document everything that is done (changes, decisions, rationale).
