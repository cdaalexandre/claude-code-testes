# Claude Code Experiments

Sandbox for experimenting with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — Anthropic's CLI tool for AI-assisted development.

## Experiments

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `create_pdf.py` | PDF generation using Python (AI-prompted) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project context file for Claude Code |

## Purpose

Testing AI-first development workflows: describing what I want in natural language, letting Claude Code implement it, then reviewing and iterating. This repo is a scratchpad for learning the tool before applying it to production projects.
